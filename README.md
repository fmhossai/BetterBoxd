## What is BetterBoxed?
BetterBoxed is a Full Stack Web application, which allows users to view movies, with a landing page that contains the latest trending and popular movies. Users can also sign up for an account and 
they can create public lists of movies, in which other users can view. Another useful feature is called the "Journal" where users can create a personalized private list of movies, and 
create notes of each movie.

## Run Locally
